Fitness Tracker - React Native Build

Built as part of an incrementally developed project in the "Building User Interfaces" course at UW-Madison in Fall 2020

This project was a great experience in working with React Native, RESTful APIs, and accessibility design. The mobile application 
communicates with an API to create unique user profiles which are saved to and pulled from a server. User's can specify health goals,
keep track of fitness activity, view their daily exercise, and their goal progress. The project is composed of multiple "screens", and
uses RESTful APIs such as GET and PUT to keep the user's information up to date, and reflect accurate data on the GUI.

Furthermore, the app uses token-based authorization, which keeps user information private, but accessible via an expiring token that
is acquired upon a successful login. In addition, accessibility features were optimized, and the app can be easily navigated through 
voice over for users with visual impairments. Another little aspect I am proud of is that I designed the "FT" logo in photoshop.

The app can be used on iOS devices with the Expo app from this link: exp://exp.host/@joehershey/fitness-tracker 

If that is not convinient, or there are issues opening the porject, here is a video demonstration: https://youtu.be/p7WYI4pUQsA
